## Pipeline Summary

**ClonalVDJSeq** orchestrates a series of bioinformatics tools to process high-throughput sequencing data for clonal libraries. The pipeline is structured as follows:

![alt text](resources/image-1.png)

1. **Setup Pipeline**: Initializes the analysis environment for each sample plate. This includes setting up directories, preparing raw data, and copying necessary primer and script files. This setup ensures that each plate's data is ready for subsequent processing steps.
  
2. **Run HTStream**: Processes raw sequencing reads to perform quality control and primer trimming. This step involves several sub-steps:
   - **Quality Control**: Utilizes HTStream's `hts_QWindowTrim` to apply quality trimming, ensuring only high-quality bases are retained.
   - **Primer Trimming**: Uses `hts_Primers` to trim sequencing adapters and primers, reducing potential artifacts in downstream analyses.
   - **Sequence Screening**: Employs `hts_SeqScreener` to remove unwanted sequences such as vectors or contaminants that could interfere with variant identification.
   - **Read Merging**: Combines paired-end reads with `hts_Overlapper`, crucial for reconstructing complete antibody sequences.
   - **Length Filtering**: Applies `hts_LengthFilter` to discard reads that do not meet the length requirements, focusing analysis on sequences of interest.

3. **DADA2 Analysis**: Executes the DADA2 pipeline to identify and quantify sequence variants, broken down into detailed steps:
   - **Error Rate Learning**: Estimates error rates from the sequencing data, which is critical for accurately modeling and correcting sequencing errors during variant inference.
   - **Dereplication**: Collapses reads into unique sequences, reducing computational complexity and improving processing efficiency.
   - **Sample Inference**: Runs the core DADA2 algorithm to infer the sample composition by distinguishing between real biological variants and sequencing errors.
   - **Merge Pairs**: Combines forward and reverse reads to reconstruct the full-length variants, crucial for antibody sequencing.
   - **Remove Chimeras**: Identifies and removes chimeric sequences that can result from PCR artifacts, ensuring the purity of variant data.
   - **Assign Taxonomy** (optional): Annotates sequences based on known databases, providing preliminary insights into the potential functionality and characteristics of the antibodies.

4. **Aggregate Results and Generate Reports**: Compiles results from all processed plates and generates comprehensive analysis reports using R Markdown. This final step provides a summarized view of the findings, allowing for easy interpretation and further research or development activities.


5. **Populate Database and Annotation**: Integrates the processed data into a database for storage and retrieval, enabling easy access to the results for future analyses. This step also annotates the sequences with additional information, such as germline gene usage, CDR/FR regions, and confidence scoring across clonal groupings. 

6. **Running Django Server**: Launches a Django server to provide a user-friendly interface for exploring the processed data, including interactive visualizations and search capabilities. This web-based interface allows users to query the database, visualize the results, and download the processed data for further analysis.



Each of these steps is designed to be modular, allowing for customization and scalability depending on the project requirements and the complexity of the sample sets.

### TODOS for Bradley?: also notes to self
- Test install instructions on a fresh machine
- Test running the pipeline on a small dataset
- See if we can make things work for not full plates? This might be a future feature request
- See what other parameters we can add to the pipeline 
  - Easy: (checking to see if things are already done instead of overwriting them) (mostly just for the runHTStream rule)
- Hard coded paths in the pipeline
- AddGene scripts?
- remove submission ID fully, using spreadsheet for that
- make sure the reporting files in there for example outputs
- add conda envs
- compare with files on cluster just to be sure
-
